# go-secure-tools
Some tools for secure sharing of resources. Built using GO and HTMX. Privacy and security comes first. Every users account includes a vault for storing their pastes, their file upload paths, and personal notes. This will include a link shortner that strips telemetry tracking and has an option for opening a secure forward proxy to improve privacy.
